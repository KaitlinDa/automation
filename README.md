## About
This automation script is designed to help document management processes for user directories. It accounts for the handling of deleted users by archiving their documents, sorts files into designated folders based on their type, and parses log files to separate errors and warnings. This is aimed at increasing efficiency and organization. This script is a useful tool for maintaining a clean and orderly file system.

## Resources
I used the help of some TA's as well as ChatGPT for this assignment.
